\title{Social Attention for Autonomous Decision-Making in Dense Traffic}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The abstract paragraph should be indented \nicefrac{1}{2}~inch (3~picas) on
  both the left- and right-hand margins. Use 10~point type, with a vertical
  spacing (leading) of 11~points.  The word \textbf{Abstract} must be centered,
  bold, and in point size 12. Two line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract
  must be limited to one paragraph.

\section{Introduction}

Automated Decision Making
Modular pipeline: perception, high level representation, decision: behaviour planning, trajectory, control
large litterature on perception
trajectory optimization and control is well understood

behaviour planning by rule-based systems, fsm
but behaviour planning is difficult, complex scenes, in particular interactions with other drivers difficult to model explicitly.
 -> leverage (deep) learning method
Learning from demonstration: nice results for lane keeping, not so much for interaction, also require costly demonstration . 

Conversely, leverage simulation:
Reinforcement learning:
Framing as an MDP, choose a good representation.
List of vehicles with their coordinates 
but variable size, + combinatorial representation
Occupancy grid / images : fixed size, tradeoff:  low accuracy vs exploding size

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Model-Free Deep Reinforcement Learning}

- MDP
- Value function
- DQN

\subsection{State Representation for Social Interactions}
In the state:
Kinematics
Not fixed size
Occupancy grid

In the model:

Weight sharing ?

\section{Model Architecture}

Motivation: 
- when fed with a complex scene description, the model should be able to filter information and consider only what is relevant for decision: ie \emph{pay attention} to vehicles that are close, and conflict with the planned route
- the model should be able to access variable number of vehicles
- the model should be invariant to the ordering of vehicles


\section{Experiments}
\subsection{The intersection task}

We consider a situation where interactions between vehicles is important: crossing an unsignalized intersection.

To that end, we use the highway-env environment and propose a novel intersection task.

- The intersection: cross (North/South/East/West), single lane or 2 lane ?
- The other vehicles: are spawned randomly, and plan a route to a random direction.
Follow a Kinematic Bicycle Model, lane keeping with a low-level steering controller, longitudinal control with IDM
